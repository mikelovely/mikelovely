                    <p>Contactzilla uses CardDAV technology to share contacts between teams. I maintained this project for about six months and added a range of new features during this time.</p>
                    <p>I integrated a "custom fields" feature for each contact. I then expanded this feature so that custom fields could be searched on, and I restructured the importer and exporter scripts to handle custom fields. I also used different APIs to allow administrators of address books to import contacts from other resources such as Office365 and Slack. I also spent time getting to grips with Google Drive API and using Google Picker to store links to documents against specified contacts.</p>
                    <p>One of the most enjoyable parts of this project was resolving a long standing issue relating to accounts being used for free when they should be paying. With over 16,000 accounts, I [investigated, used reason and logic, worked on a sample of data] to produce a list of thousands of accounts to be flagged for deletion.</p>

                    <p>I integrated several payment gateways in to an existing Symfony2 project, specifically; Yandex, Mercado Pago, 2Checkout and Payfast. This involved a lot of interesting edge-cases when needing to show or hide certain payment methods at checkout. BaseKit were really happy with work and came back to us for help with an Ionic 2 application.</p>
                    <p>The most challenging part of this project was understanding the various flows each gateway would use for authorising payments.</p>

                    <p>I added new Content Types, and some new Views. I installed the Mini-Blocks module so the clients could update certain sections of the site, previously out of scope of the CMS.</p>
